## Introduction

- We analyze the Formula 1 World Championship dataset (1950–2020) from Kaggle.  
- Goal: Predict race outcomes using statistical and machine learning models in R.  
- Focus: Identify factors that influence where a driver finishes.

---

## Data Overview

The dataset includes:

- Drivers  
- Teams (Constructors)  
- Races  
- Results  
- Lap Times  
- Pit Stops  
- Qualifying Sessions  

---

## Features Used

Key predictors considered:

- **Grid Position**  
- **Average Lap Time**  
- **Pit Stop Count**  
- **Driver Performance History**  
- **Constructor Strength**  

---

## Methods

Our workflow includes:

1. Data cleaning and merging  
2. Feature engineering  
   - Average lap time  
   - Pit stop totals  
   - Team performance metrics  
3. Model testing  
   - Ridge Regression  
   - LASSO  
   - Logistic Regression  

---

## Model Comparison

- Evaluate accuracy and predictive performance  
- Compare coefficients and variable importance  
- Assess overfitting using cross-validation  

---

## Early Insights (Template)

*(Replace with results once computed)*

- Grid position appears to be a strong predictor  
- Faster average lap times correlate with better finishes  
- Teams with stronger constructors show consistent advantage  

---

## Conclusion

- Multiple factors influence F1 race outcomes  
- Our models help identify which metrics matter most  
- Future improvements: incorporate weather, track characteristics, and season trends
