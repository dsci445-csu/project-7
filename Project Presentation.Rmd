## Motivation and Design

**Main Point:** Understanding how defensive strategies impact NFL play outcomes.

-   **Focus:** Investigate if more defenders in the box reduce offensive yards gained.

-   **Significance:**

    -   Helps coaches balance between rushing and coverage plays.

    -   Guides decisions on optimizing defensive play-calling.

-   **Inspiration:**

    -   Shared passion for football and analytics.

    -   Contribute to the growing field of sports analytics.


## Methodology

-   Data Preparation
    -   Filtered passing plays; cleaned data to 17,330 observations. Response variable: offensive yards gained (excluding penalties). Predictors: number of defenders in the box and pass rushers. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    -   Visual tools: boxplots, heatmaps, correlation matrix. Pass rushers showed slightly stronger correlation with play result (0.032) than defenders in the box (0.006).

-   **Modeling:**
    -   Linear Regression: Captures direct linear relationships.
    -   Generalized Additive Model (GAM): Accounts for non-linear relationships with smooth terms.
    -   Train-test split (80/20) and 5-fold cross-validation for performance evaluation.

# Model Results
   

## Results

    Number of Defenders in the Box and Pass Rushers vs. Play Result
    
    -In General, both linear regression and GAM explain very little variance 
    in playResult, with low R-squared values and high RMSE:

    Linear Regression RMSE: 9.847673 
    GAM RMSE: 9.834928

    -The number of pass rushers showed a strong relationship with playResult
    (Estimate coefficient = 0.381, P-value = 0.000162), compared to defenders 
    in the box (P-value = 0.985).  

    -The GAM slightly outperforms linear regression, but the improvement is
    not significant.

## Linear Regression Model

## Random Forest Results
  
    - The random forest was only able to accurately predict the relationship on
    playResult from defendersInTheBox and numberOfPassRushers with an accuracy
    of 4.53%
    - However, numberOfPassRushers had an importance score of 6791 and defenders
    in the box had importance score of 4881.880

## XGBoost Results

    -Test RMSE: 9.83
    -Slight improvements could be the result of less overfitting and 
    presence of interactions between features

## Predicting EPA With Pre-snap Variables

    -Variables used quarter, down, yards to go, offensive formation, 
    defenders in the box, and absolute yard number.
