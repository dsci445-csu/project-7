Data Exploration:

We have an initial idea of looking at the number of pass rushers and the number of defenders in the box and the effect that had on play outcome. Outcome here can be a completed pass, incomplete pass, penalty, sack, or rush. We are utilizing the plays.csv file from kaggle. I will explore this topic below:

```{r}
# Read in csv File
plays <- read.csv("plays.csv")

# Give Variable Names
names(plays)

# Examine Important Variables
plays$playType
plays$playResult
plays$yardsToGo
plays$typeDropback
plays$playId
plays$playDescription
plays$defendersInTheBox
plays$numberOfPassRushers
plays$passResult
plays$isDefensivePI
plays$epa
plays$down
plays$
