## Introduction

We are using the Formula 1 World Championship dataset from Kaggle (1950–2020) to predict race outcomes.  
Our goal is to build a model in R to determine which factors help predict how drivers will finish.

## Data

The dataset includes information on:

- Drivers  
- Teams  
- Races  
- Results  
- Lap times  
- Pit stops  
- Qualifying sessions  

We plan to use features such as:

- Grid position  
- Lap times  
- Pit stops  
- Driver history  
- Constructor (team) performance  

## Methods

Our process will include:

1. Cleaning and merging the data in R  
2. Creating features such as average lap time, pit stop counts, team strength, and qualifying times  
3. Testing models such as ridge regression, LASSO, and logistic regression  
4. Comparing model performance and accuracy  

## Conclusion

This project will help us understand which factors influence Formula 1 race outcomes and how well these variables can be used to predict race results.
